Today, Kevin Kwok and Guillermo Webster launched (link:https://alpha.trycarbide.com/ text:Carbide) from HVF Labs. Carbide is an browser-based Javascript programming environment that enables interactive data visualization, in-line (and in-context) data tools, and code-notebook style coding.

Carbide doesn't distinguish between input and output, using generalized machine learning techniques to run programs backwards.

We're pleased to work with both of these rising seniors at MIT!
