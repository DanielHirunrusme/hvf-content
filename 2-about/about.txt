Founders join us to play with, think deeply about, and work on hard problems.  HVF creates companies, including Yelp, Affirm, and Glow.

**HARD TECH THAT SOLVES HARD PROBLEMS.**  HVF focuses on technology and data advantages that can solve substantial problems.  We found a company after a compelling technology becomes broadly accessible.

**WORK TOGETHER, ON WHAT CAPTIVATES YOU.**  Our Entrepreneurs in Residence and core team work on proto-ideas of their choosing.  Founding teams are forged by searching and working together.  We draw from HVF's community of founders, friends, and Levchin portfolio companies.

**FOCUS ON 1-2 PROJECTS AT A TIME.**  Your ideas get our complete attention.  Expect strategic advice, deep product and technical contributions, with a team of involved co-founders.

**WITH OUR FOUNDERS FOR THE LONG HAUL.**  We work alongside our Companies in Residence for 12-24 months.  HVF remains deeply involved in the companies we start, and in our alumni.
