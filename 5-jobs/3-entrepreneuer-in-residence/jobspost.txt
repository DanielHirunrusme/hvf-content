**Start your next company with us.**   Our EIRs are decorated former founders and early stage team members.  Founding the next involves a blank sheet of paper with commensurate exhilaration, excitement, and apprehension.  

Welcome to the halfway house.  Work 6-months alongside our core team – from which you can co-found with and hire from.  We support EIRs with a culture of experimentation, an involved team of technologists and product managers, and access to the HVF/Levchin network.  You will have 24-hour access to great office facilities, strategic advice, concrete product and technical contributions, fundraising assistance, and a team invested in your success.

Companies started at HVF have the option to remain as Companies in Residence for an additional 12-18 months.  We’re proud of the companies that started here, and remain deeply involved in the people and companies that have come through HVF Labs.

HVF Labs is Max Levchin’s company creation laboratory.  This is a full-time position in San Francisco, in an office we share with HVF-created companies.  We offer cash compensation, equity in the companies we start, great health insurance, commuter and gym benefits, and unlimited vacation.
