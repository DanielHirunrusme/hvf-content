Richtext: 

Hard Valuable Fun partners with people to start companies that create new technologies, products, and services. We focus on a couple projects at a time, with the intention of picking the best and turning them into transformational organizations.

We partner with proven past (and high potential future) founders and operators. We work with them to search for and build new companies. From a rich experience of starting and growing technology products and services, the Labs team collectively applies its experience and interests to these projects. These projects are Hard, Valuable, and Fun.

To date, two of these projects have become companies: Affirm and Glow.

HVF is not an incubator, and is not it a VC fund. We work on internally-generated ideas but actively take input from other people and other industries with the goal of growing the core team.
